<h3>üë©‚ÄçüíªWhat is Disruptive Technology?üë©‚Äçüíª</h3>

<p>
It is no stranger to all that technology is affecting our way of living. In terms of education, communication, businesses, etc., these sectors have been thriving through its help. Over time, technology has given significant benefits through the creation of innovative concepts to provide comfort, ease, and convenience. However, despite its benefits, it also has its consequences; one of them is known as Disruptive Technology. <br>

According to Tim Smith (2022), Disruptive Technology contains harmful effects, and the created technology, despite its good intentions, is being altered into something that can negatively impact people. It defeats the original purpose as to why technology is created, eventually harming the principal sector, whether it would be for education, communication, business, agriculture, etc., that instead of letting it thrive, it ultimately does the opposite (Bower & Christensen, 1995). <br>

The negative consequences of technological disruption on a variety of enterprises in the 21st century, one of which includes artificial intelligence. Hence, AI is a component of the current wave of disruptive technologies. For instance, the harm of AI in applications is a major concern, especially for data privacy and protection. Privacy is violated and social manipulation, such as "data poisoning," is conceivable when machine learning-based data is altered (Brundage et al., 2018). One of the ways of doing this is through bots, where cybercriminals abuse artificial intelligence to commit crimes such as ransomware and email phishing. This is comparable to how people have created deepfake, a technology that uses AI to build a convincing digital duplicate of a person‚Äôs face, which can then be used to create content based on it. However, this technology, while it contains fun and entertainment for many, is also being used in disturbing ways. For instance, the rising usage and realism of deepfake material for fake sexual content and smear campaigns make this rather alarming in the modern times. <br>

<h3>üß†What is Artificial Intelligence (in the context of Data Privacy)?üß†</h3>

<p>
While computers do functions that require humans to carry out a task, Artificial Intelligence can do the same function on its own through the same computer if programmed correctly; therefore AI can copy human intelligence in some specific tasks (Anadot, n.d.). <br>

In the context of data privacy, Artificial Intelligence actually plays a huge role in it when it comes to consumer data. Artificial intelligence has always been a great help for various institutions such as businesses, universities, and healthcare due to its capabilities of identifying and controlling data and providing a better service and user experience for people (User-centric, 2022). For these purposes, sometimes, different websites and applications we used asked for our consent to share our personal information, agreeing to terms and conditions, and enabling cookies (Das, 2020). Users' apprehension over automated technologies that collect and use their data, potentially containing sensitive information, is understandable. Because accurate data is necessary for AI models to produce actionable results, privacy protection must be a fundamental component of their design. <br>

While privacy protection is vital, recent technological advances, including websites that need our personal and sensitive information, make it seem harder nowadays as they store our data (Koerner, 2022). For example, when we log into a website, they may ask if we want to accept their cookies to have a better algorithm of what to show you based on your search history. It can be helpful, but it can also be dangerous once the information they got from you gets leaked. <br>

Allowing our data to be in the hands of verified websites may be safe. However, with the widespread existence of malicious websites and applications, it is now hard to determine the safety of these applications, leaving our data privacy unprotected and making us, netizens, more vulnerable to data breaches and scams. With the evolution of artificial intelligence throughout the years, stealing our identities has become much easier. <br>

<h3>üåêWhy is AI considered Disruptive Technology?üåê</h3>

<p>
Artificial intelligence is considered a disruptive technology as it prompts disruptive innovation that brought us game-changing products and services able to serve low-end or unserved consumers and migrate to the mainstream that replaced the sustaining-based companies (Khamis, 2019). As much as it is a great chance for innovation that greatly alters the way how consumers and businesses function, it has its downsides, especially in the context of data privacy. To expound, it gathers our information based on what sites we access, what apps we download, what we search on the Internet, etc. It affects the way we use the Internet to give us an ‚Äúeasier‚Äù time surfing it based on our interests. It encompasses predictive analytics that procures advantages to the sites or products aligned within the algorithm that the AI has identified. Predictive analytics is simply indicative of another useful characteristic of complex AI programs: pattern recognition. In a study by Gravrock (2022), A lot of our data is used to develop AI-based technologies. How it functions will depend on how much information it can collect from us, resulting in relying on the quality of data it manages to gather. With this, consumers tend to be concerned about their privacy when the former is mentioned. In fact, according to the European Consumer Organization (2020, as cited in Gravrock, 2022), one survey indicated that 45%-60% of Europeans agreed that AI will lead to the profound abuse of personal information. <br>

Consequently, this ability of AI in cybersecurity to be programmed in technology pervades every sector using machine intelligence that can also imitate human behavior. For example, in customer service through a chatbot, businesses use this model to simulate conversations with human users. This AI may satisfy the customer with 24/7 availability than hiring many employees, however, would result in lower performance as it has limited responses as the chatbot is a program to answer the questions from the database. <br>

With Businesses, Artificial intelligence enables them to better predict the next hot item by understanding human behaviors (Simplilearn, 2022). Therefore, challenges such as data persistence, repurposing, and spillovers occur. Furthermore, businesses can also gather data through social media algorithms. For example, Facebook collects the data of its users often without their consent. The said information is used as the data expert (i.e., Facebook) engages in extensive data sharing and monetization, controlling the majority of the data flow in the digital ecosystem due to their substantial digital technology resources, which also allow them to own it. With this, they can draw in new clients by performing extended data wrapping wherein data experts sell their clients' data to other clients, such as advertisers, who use the insights to reach their target customers (Quach et al., 2022). <br>

To delve into Federated learning, as defined by IBM, is a way to train AI models without anyone seeing or touching your data, offering a way to unlock information to feed new AI applications (Martineau, 2022),  AI technology takes a decentralized approach to data collection by creating data models from various sources without gaining access to the original information. Simply put, AI models can process data without leaving the data's source device (laptops, phones, tablets, etc.) Federated learning is gradually disrupting the tech industry by becoming the standard for new data regulations and private data storage (Martineau, 2022). In this way, consumer data will not be compromised; on the contrary, AI technology becomes more than capable of protecting private data. The sophisticated automation brought on by AI is currently disrupting people's jobs. To Morgan (2019), Artificial Intelligence is displacing people, either by automating menial tasks or moving them to more productive ones. Thus, making it one of the most disruptive technologies of today. <br>

Interestingly, AI technology disrupts the tech industry from both ends of the data privacy context. While causing trepidation due to its conduct of personal data collection, utilization, and management, AI technology simultaneously impacts the industry by combating such threats through data protection and cybersecurity. First, cyber security and data security companies have expanded their services from preventing targeted virus attacks and hacking incidents to including customer data privacy and data protection. The capability of AI to accurately process a significant amount of data in a short period is its most valued asset. According to Protegrity's EVP of Data and AI Eliano Marques, AI technology accelerates the process of data protection through data identification (Clark, 2021). By rapidly identifying which data within hundreds of databases need to be protected, AI expedites the process and ensures improved data privacy for consumers (Clark, 2021).
