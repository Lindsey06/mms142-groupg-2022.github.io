<h3>What is Disruptive Technology?</h3>

<p>
It is no stranger to all that technology is affecting our way of living. In terms of education, communication, businesses, etc., these sectors have been thriving through its help. Over time, technology has given significant benefits through the creation of innovative concepts to provide comfort, ease, and convenience. However, despite its benefits, it also has its consequences; one of them is known as Disruptive Technology. <br>

According to Tim Smith (2022), Disruptive Technology contains harmful effects, and the created technology, despite its good intentions, is being altered into something that can negatively impact people. It defeats the original purpose as to why technology is created, eventually harming the principal sector, whether it would be for education, communication, business, agriculture, etc., that instead of letting it thrive, it ultimately does the opposite (Bower & Christensen, 1995). <br>

The negative consequences of technological disruption on a variety of enterprises in the 21st century, one of which includes artificial intelligence. Hence, AI is a component of the current wave of disruptive technologies. For instance, the harm of AI in applications is a major concern, especially for data privacy and protection. Privacy is violated and social manipulation, such as "data poisoning," is conceivable when machine learning-based data is altered (Brundage et al., 2018). One of the ways of doing this is through bots, where cybercriminals abuse artificial intelligence to commit crimes such as ransomware and email phishing. This is comparable to how people have created deepfake, a technology that uses AI to build a convincing digital duplicate of a personâ€™s face, which can then be used to create content based on it. However, this technology, while it contains fun and entertainment for many, is also being used in disturbing ways. For instance, the rising usage and realism of deepfake material for fake sexual content and smear campaigns make this rather alarming in the modern times. <br>

<h3>What is Artificial Intelligence (in the context of Data Privacy)?</h3>

<p>
While computers do functions that require humans to carry out a task, Artificial Intelligence can do the same function on its own through the same computer if programmed correctly; therefore AI can copy human intelligence in some specific tasks (Anadot, n.d.). <br>

In the context of data privacy, Artificial Intelligence actually plays a huge role in it when it comes to consumer data. Artificial intelligence has always been a great help for various institutions such as businesses, universities, and healthcare due to its capabilities of identifying and controlling data and providing a better service and user experience for people (User-centric, 2022). For these purposes, sometimes, different websites and applications we used asked for our consent to share our personal information, agreeing to terms and conditions, and enabling cookies (Das, 2020). Users' apprehension over automated technologies that collect and use their data, potentially containing sensitive information, is understandable. Because accurate data is necessary for AI models to produce actionable results, privacy protection must be a fundamental component of their design. <br>

While privacy protection is vital, recent technological advances, including websites that need our personal and sensitive information, make it seem harder nowadays as they store our data (Koerner, 2022). For example, when we log into a website, they may ask if we want to accept their cookies to have a better algorithm of what to show you based on your search history. It can be helpful, but it can also be dangerous once the information they got from you gets leaked. <br>

Allowing our data to be in the hands of verified websites may be safe. However, with the widespread existence of malicious websites and applications, it is now hard to determine the safety of these applications, leaving our data privacy unprotected and making us, netizens, more vulnerable to data breaches and scams. With the evolution of artificial intelligence throughout the years, stealing our identities has become much easier. <br>
